## Project status

This project is incomplete and a work in progress. Much of the Space Traders API is meant for
developers to experiment and learn new things using the API. As such, the game is in alpha, which
would make this project pre-alpha. It will change constantly and things will be broken. Follow the
project and see how things will (hopefully) improve!

## Project setup

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```

### Compiles and minifies for production
